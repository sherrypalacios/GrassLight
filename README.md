# GrassLight in Python

Thank you for visiting. The Python code and instructions you find here are derived from the FORTRAN version of GrassLight created by Dr. Richard C. Zimmerman and Dr. Charles L. Gallegos, and provided to us by Dr. Zimmerman. GrassLight is the coded version of the seagrass physiological model described in Zimmerman (2003).

The code is composed of a main body - the operator, and subroutines that compute the optical, chemical, and biological componenets of the seagrass model. The task of porting the FORTRAN code to Python (3.X) has been taken up by Dr. Sherry Palacios (California State University, Monterey Bay - CSUMB), and a series of her undergraduate research students, including Brandon Tom, Dakota Nance, and Annie Hansen.

As of September 9, 2022, this is still a work in progress.
