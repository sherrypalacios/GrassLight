# GrassLight in Python

Thank you for visiting. The Python code and instructions you find here are derived from the FORTRAN version of GrassLight created by Dr. Richard C. Zimmerman and Dr. Charles L. Gallegos, and provided to us by Dr. Zimmerman with permission to port to Python. GrassLight is the coded version of the seagrass physiological model described in Zimmerman (2003).

The code is composed of a main body - the operator, and subroutines that compute the optical, chemical, and biological componenets of the seagrass model.

The model is run from main.py. As of this writing, all components of this Python version of GrassLight are still under development. The hope is that main.py and all of the subroutines will be completed by June 2023. If you have further questions, please contact Sherry Palacios (sherry.palacios@gmail.com).

The task of porting the FORTRAN code to Python (3.X) is undertaken by Dr. Sherry Palacios (California State University, Monterey Bay - CSUMB), and a series of her undergraduate research students, including Brandon Tom, Dakota Nance, and Annie Hansen. Funding provided by the CSUMB College of Science Discovery, Creation, and Innovation Fund (S Palacios) and the CSUMB Undergraduate Research Opportunities Center (UROC) (A Hansen) helped to support this work.
